## Advanced Lane Finding

This was the second project in Udacity's Self Driving Car NanoDegree. Following the first attempt at lane finding, I learned and applied better techniques to get a better detection of lanes. In this repository is my write up, the Jupyter notebook with the raw code, and the output video showing my lane detection algorithm.
